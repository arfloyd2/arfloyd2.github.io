# Blog Post for Project 3 Reflections 

## what would you do differently?

I think that in the future, for a task this large, I would definitely encourage a structured set of planning and scheduling ahead of time, as coordinating updated status meetings. The process of working on a collaborative platform as well as working on providing analysis for the same data set could be a bit tricky, as it can be easy to do similar or the same analysis for target variable, or run into snags during the upload process of collaboration on GitHub, so frequent status updates and having a solid plan could help to keep everyone abreast of the status of the project, and approach any challenges early in the process. I would also encourage that each group member have their own branch if they are working in a version control platform like GitHub. 

## what was the most difficult part for you?
The most difficult portion of this project was the collaboration on GitHub. I understand that the platform can be very useful, but the merge process and the file sharing process took a significant amount of time to navigate. That added layer of complexity and time to the overall project that made the process challenging. I find that working on GitHub is the most challenging part of most of these projects. 

##  What are your big take-aways from this project? 
My biggest take away from this is that I sometimes need to stand firm in my work and my position on certain aspects to get things done.
